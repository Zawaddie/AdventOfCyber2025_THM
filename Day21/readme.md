And in our kingdom of Wareville, just like in others, thousands of files of all kinds pass through the systems every day, from DOCX, PDF resumes received by our elves, to financial spreadsheets, CSVs from the accounting department, and executable files launched by different applications. But have you ever wondered which of these might be malicious? Which ones could actually belong to King Malhare? An interesting question, isn’t it?

Learning Objectives
In this task, the TBFC SOC team will investigate one specific file type, the HTA format - a type often used for legitimate purposes, yet just as frequently exploited by attackers. Your mission is to reverse-engineer the HTA and uncover how King Malhare tricked Wareville’s elves. 
To do this, you will have to look for:

- Application metadata
- Script functions
- Any network calls or encoded data
- Clues about exfiltration
