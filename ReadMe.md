Right before the Christmas Celebrations, AoC is a yearly delight crowning each year.

Whereas the prizes that come with completing the AoC 24 Days pre-Christmas challenge, I believe that every year the challenges capture an up-to date and current cybersecurity ideas facing organization. This gives a greater motivation to keep going day by day.

So excited of this year's journey.
